      <p>My name is <strong>Nicol√°s Uriel Navall</strong> and I
      am an Argentinian computer science student that loves to express himself
      creatively with code.</p><p>I like to make stuff, specially the process of making something out of nothing. I like to use
      programming as a creative outlet with projects and learn in the process.</p><p>
      My interests vary from programming stuff that I find useful (and hope
      others find useful as well), game design, virtual photography, programming
      shaders and just writing in general, as you may have noticed with this
      site.</p>

      <p>You can also check out some game projects I have been involved in on
      <a href="https://itch.io/profile/originalnicodr">itch.io</a>. I also tend
      to collaborate on the <a href="https://framedsc.com/">Framed site</a> by writing guides,
      maintenance, and more.</p>
